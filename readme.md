## Project Timeline:        
### 18/08/22: Beginning the project     
- Decided upon 'Guess Who' after weighing up options, doing Opportunity/Risk analysis.      
- Set up GitHub repository for project, established basic file structure, added README, first commit made.

## 18/08/22: Beginning the project:        
- Settled on 'Guess Who?' - or some variant thereof - as my choice of game to build. I came to this decision on the basis that it is simple enough to be achievable in the timeframe given: I'd much rather execute a simple idea well than overcommit and end up with a half-finished project. A version of this game was included in the examples shown before the project, I also took advice from a GA alum who agreed that it would make for an interesting (and achievable) project. See section 'What might have been...' below for rejected ideas!        
- Repository established, basic file structure set up, README started.

### Opportunities identified:      
- Game should be an achievable project in time given.       
- Not an 'action' game with many simultaneously moving parts so it should be easier to animate well.        
- Programming the computer to guess will likely be an interesting challenge.        
- Potential for both Player vs. Computer and Player vs. Player modes.       
- Short game duration - minimises risk of code breaking down.       
- Well-known game with simple concept and rules - familiar and accessible to most.       
- It's a fun game to play!      

### Potential risks:      
- Possibly under-ambitious? Better than the opposite though!        
- Game might not be visually compelling enough - characters must be interesting to look at and animations need to be slick.     
- Game art is not something I am naturally good at. It's important I push myself here but there is a risk of this area becoming a significant time-sink.        
- 'AI' could be under/over powered - need to ensure balanced gameplay.      
- PvP on one screen may be a challenge - how to ensure player's cards/choices remain secret?        

## Unsolved Issues:

## What might have been...(rejected ideas):     

### Cluedo:     
- Too ambitious! Potentially a very interesting project but was warned off this, especially due to the challenges around handling multi-directional character movement as well as game duration: "long game = code more likely to break".       
- Multiple players: either needs 6 people to play on one screen (cumbersome/clumsy) or 5 separate 'AI' (probably beyond my current skillset). One for the future, maybe!        

### Scrabble:       
- Would require a dictionary-type API. No way I'm going to manually input every word in the dictionary! 'Scrabble - but only with words beginning with 'A'' not likely to become an instant classic.        
- Programming a computer opponent that doesn't just choose the optimal word each time is going to be a problem.     

### Bohnanza:       
- I love this game, but not many people have heard of it!       
- Also quite a long game and faces similar AI issues as above.      

### Battleships:        
- Great game and fun project but my friend already did this!
